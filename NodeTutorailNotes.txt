What is Node.js?
--> It is a javascript runtime
--> It allows us to run javascript in any environment outside web browser (example : on a server)
--> Uses V8 engine to run javascript
--> Takes js code and compiles it to machine code (which is done by browser)
--> Machine code is run by a computer
--> Apart from V8 features which is written in C++ and adds additional features like file system operation (cannot be done inside browser)
--> Unlike browser, since we are running js code directly we do not have DOM objects



Node REPL? 
--> Directly execute code in command line and parse it in instantly
--> Example : 2 + 2
